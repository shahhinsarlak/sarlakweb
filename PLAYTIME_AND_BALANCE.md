- **Hardcore Player** (4+ hrs/day): 2-4 days
- **Completionist** (100%): 10-15 days

---

## Progression Curve Analysis

### Phase 1: Early Game (Day 1-3)
**PP Range:** 0 - 2,000
**Time:** 2-4 hours

**Progression:**
```
Starting: 1 PP/click, 2 energy cost
First Upgrade (50 PP): +2 PP/click = 3 PP/click total
- Requires ~25 clicks (50 energy) → ~10 minutes

Second Upgrade (150 PP): +1 PP/sec passive
- With 3 PP/click: ~50 clicks (100 energy) → ~20 minutes
- Includes passive income generation

Third Upgrade (200 PP): Printer Room unlock
- Critical unlock for dual-currency system
- ~40 clicks with passive income → ~15 minutes

Fourth Upgrade (300 PP): +5 PP/click = 8 PP/click total
- ~40 clicks → ~15 minutes
```

**Early Game Balance:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- Smooth progression with regular unlocks
- Energy management creates meaningful decisions
- 30s rest cooldown prevents idle abuse while allowing recovery

### Phase 2: Mid Game (Day 4-10)
**PP Range:** 2,000 - 20,000
**Time:** 6-12 hours

**Key Milestones:**
- **500 PP**: Debug Access unlock (engage with code debugging minigame)
- **800 PP**: +20 max energy (critical for extended sessions)
- **1,200 PP**: +3 PP/sec (passive income accelerates)
- **2,500 PP**: Sanity regeneration (sanity management becomes easier)
- **12,000 PP**: +10 PP/sec (major passive boost)

**PP Generation at Mid Game:**
- Manual: 8+ PP/click
- Passive: 14+ PP/sec (with all upgrades)
- Combined: ~900 PP/minute with active play

**Mid Game Balance:** ✅ **GOOD**
- Passive income allows offline progress
- Debug challenges provide alternative PP source (200-500 PP per success)
- Portal unlock (Day 7, 20 theme toggles) gates dimensional content appropriately

### Phase 3: Late Game (Day 10-20)
**PP Range:** 20,000 - 100,000+
**Time:** 12-24 hours

**Focus:** Dimensional mining, printer mastery, achievement hunting

**Dimensional Material Rarity:**
| Material | Rarity | Avg/Portal | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| Void Fragment | 40% | ~8 | Common crafting material |
| Static Crystal | 30% | ~6 | Common crafting material |
| Glitch Shard | 20% | ~4 | Mid-tier crafting |
| Reality Dust | 8% | ~1-2 | Rare crafting |
| Temporal Core | 1.5% | ~0-1 | Very rare |
| Dimensional Essence | 0.4% | ~0 (1 per 2-3 portals) | Ultra rare |
| Singularity Node | 0.1% | ~0 (1 per 10 portals) | Legendary |

**Portal Economics:**
- Capacity: 20 items (40 with Reality Stabilizer)
- Cooldown: 60s (30s with Dimensional Anchor)
- Average run: 3-5 minutes to collect 20 items
- Items per hour: ~240-400 (depending on upgrades)

**Late Game Balance:** ⚠️ **MINOR ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED**
- Singularity Node (0.1% rarity) requires 3 for final upgrade
- Estimated 30+ portal runs for 3 nodes (3-5 hours of grinding)
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Increase rarity to 0.15% or reduce requirement to 2 nodes

### Phase 4: Endgame (Day 20+)
**PP Range:** 100,000+
**Focus:** Achievement completion, 100% upgrades, narrative completion

**RECOMMENDATION:** Reality Printer could be slightly cheaper (8000 PP, 800 Paper) to encourage more players to reach it.

### Dimensional Upgrades (Material-based)

**Portal Enhancement:**
| Upgrade | Materials | Effect | Balance |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Dimensional Anchor | 5 Void, 3 Crystal | 30s cooldown | ✅ Excellent (2x faster runs) |
| Reality Stabilizer | 10 Glitch, 5 Dust | 40 capacity | ✅ Good (2x items/run) |
| Temporal Accelerator | 3 Temporal Core | Faster respawn | ⚠️ Effect unclear |

**Sanity Management:**
| Upgrade | Materials | Effect | Balance |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Void Shield | 20 Void | +0.5 sanity/sec | ✅ Good |
| Crystal Meditation | 15 Crystal | 2x meditation | ✅ Excellent |
| Reality Anchor | 8 Dust, 2 Essence | 20% min sanity | ✅ Critical for low sanity |

**Production:**
| Upgrade | Materials | Effect | Balance |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Glitch Compiler | 25 Glitch | 2x debug rewards | ✅ Excellent |
| Essence Converter | 1 Essence | PP→Materials | ⚠️ Not implemented? |
| Singularity Engine | 1 Singularity | +50 PP/sec | ✅ Massive boost |

**Endgame:**
| Upgrade | Materials | Effect | Balance |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Singularity Collapse | 3 Singularity | Final ending | ⚠️ Very grindy |

**Dimensional Upgrade Balance:** ⚠️ **NEEDS MINOR ADJUSTMENTS**

**Issues:**
1. **Temporal Accelerator** - Effect "faster respawn" not clearly implemented
2. **Essence Converter** - Not implemented in code (listed as future feature)
3. **Singularity Collapse** - 3 nodes at 0.1% rarity = too grindy

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Implement or remove Temporal Accelerator effect
2. Either implement Essence Converter or mark as "Coming Soon"
3. Reduce Singularity Collapse to 2 nodes OR increase spawn rate to 0.15%
4. Material Scanner and Void Sight could have visible in-game effects

## Balance Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Balance Issues

**1. Singularity Node Availability**
```javascript
// Current
{ id: 'singularity_node', rarity: 0.001 } // 0.1%

// Recommended
{ id: 'singularity_node', rarity: 0.0015 } // 0.15% (+50%)

// OR reduce final cost
materials: { singularity_node: 2 } // Instead of 3
```

**2. Dimensional Void Regeneration Bug**
✅ **FIXED** - Material nodes now static per portal session

**3. Portal Unlock Screen Shake**
✅ **FIXED** - Added screen shake effect

### Priority 2: QoL Improvements

// Add clear implementation or rename
desc: 'Materials regenerate 30s faster after leaving portal.'
// And implement the actual effect
```

**2. Reality Printer Cost Reduction**
```javascript
// Current
costs: { pp: 10000, paper: 1000 }

// Recommended
costs: { pp: 8000, paper: 800 }
```

**3. Achievement Progress Hints**
- Add Dimensional Codex upgrade that reveals achievement progress
- Currently listed but effect unclear in UI

### Priority 3: Optional Enhancements

**1. Skill Tree Integration**
- Currently only has test_skill_1
- Add full skill tree for replayability
- Skills should interact with all systems (PP, Energy, Materials)

**2. Prestige System**
- For players who want to replay with bonuses
- Unlock after reaching Day 30 or completing final upgrade

**3. Dynamic Scaling**
- Later upgrades could scale based on previous purchases
- Prevents linear grind, rewards strategic planning

## Progression Formula Analysis

### PP Growth Curve

**Manual Clicking (optimal play):**
```
Minute 1-10: 1 PP/click × 30 clicks/min = 30 PP/min
Minute 10-30: 3 PP/click × 30 clicks/min = 90 PP/min
Minute 30-60: 8 PP/click × 30 clicks/min = 240 PP/min
Hour 2+: 8 PP/click × 30 clicks/min + 14 PP/sec passive = 1080 PP/min
```

**Time to Major Milestones:**
- 50 PP (first upgrade): ~2-3 minutes
- 500 PP (debug unlock): ~8-12 minutes with passive
- 2,500 PP (sanity regen): ~30-40 minutes
- 12,000 PP (senior analyst): ~2-3 hours
- 100,000 PP (late game): ~8-12 hours total

**Growth is exponential, not linear** - ✅ **GOOD DESIGN**

### Material Collection Rate

**Base Portal Run (20 capacity, no upgrades):**
- Time: 3-5 minutes
- Common materials (Void, Crystal): 10-14 per run
- Rare materials (Dust, Core): 0-2 per run
- Ultra-rare (Essence, Singularity): 0-1 per 5+ runs

**With All Upgrades (40 capacity, 30s cooldown):**
- Time: 2-3 minutes
- Common materials: 20-28 per run
- Rare materials: 2-4 per run
- Ultra-rare: Still very rare

**Estimated Time to Key Materials:**
- 20 Void Fragments: 1-2 portal runs = 10 minutes
- 1 Temporal Core: 5-10 portal runs = 30-60 minutes
- 1 Dimensional Essence: 10-20 portal runs = 60-120 minutes
- 3 Singularity Nodes: 30-50 portal runs = 3-5 hours ⚠️
